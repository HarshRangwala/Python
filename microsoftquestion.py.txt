# MicroSoft Interview Question
# Calculate difficulty of a given sentence. Here a Word is considered hard if it has 4 consecutive consonants or number of 
# consonants are more than number of vowels. Else word is easy.
# Difficulty of sentence is defined as 5(number of hard words) + 3(number of easy words).
